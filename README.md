= Demo rules for Insights =

This is a basic rule repository for Insights.  The contents are simple but they
are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how to write rules and tests.

Obviously, Red Hat doesn't provide support for using these rules, but patches
and suggestions are welcome if you can figure out how to provide them.
